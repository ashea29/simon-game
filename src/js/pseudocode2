PSEUDOCODE:

Define five functions (one for each round), called: roundOne, roundTwo, roundThree, roundFour, roundFive

roundOne is called when the start button is pressed

For each round, first clear the values in gamePattern and userPattern. Then, call a flashButtons function (current function with this name could be renamed flashAll), which will utilize the forEach method.

    gameOn = false

    gamePattern = []
    userPattern = []

    turnCounter.innerHTML = NUMBER (whichever round this is)

    turnNumber = NUMBER (whichever round this is)

    gamePattern.push(Math.floor(Math.random()*4)+1)

    (IN ROUNDS TWO THROUGH FOUR:
      for (i=1; i <= turnNumber; i++){
        gamePattern.push(Math.floor(Math.random()*4)+1)
      }
    )

    gamePattern.forEach(flashButtons)

    function flashButtons(item, index){

      let interval = setInterval( () => {
      if (item == 1){
        flashGreenBtn()
      } else if (item == 2){
        flashRedBtn()
      } else if (item == 3){
        flashYellowBtn
      } else if (item == 4){
        flashBlueBtn
      }
        clearInterval(interval)
    }, 1000)
    }

    gameOn = true

     if (userPattern === gamePattern){
      alert or modal saying "Correct!"
      (then call the function for whatever the next round is)
    } else if (userPattern !== gamePattern){
      alert or modal saying "Incorrect! Try again..."
      (call the function for this round again)
    }
    
    =================================

    function checkForWin(){
      if (turnNumber == 5 && userPattern === gamePattern){
        alert or modal saying "YOU WIN!"
        possibly have a button called "PLAY AGAIN" which calls the roundOne function
      }
    }
